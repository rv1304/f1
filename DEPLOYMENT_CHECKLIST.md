## 🚀 **Backup Plans**

### **If Backend Fails to Start**
```bash
# Check port conflicts
netstat -ano | findstr :4000

# Kill conflicting process
taskkill /PID <PID_NUMBER> /F

# Restart backend
cd backend && npm start
```

### **If Frontend Fails to Load**
```bash
# Check port conflicts
netstat -ano | findstr :3000

# Use alternative port
cd frontend && npm run dev -- --port 3001
```

### **If WebSocket Connection Fails**
- Check Windows Firewall settings
- Verify both servers are running
- Use browser developer tools to debug connection

### **If Demo Data Doesn't Load**
```bash
# Create manual demo race
curl -X POST http://localhost:4000/api/demo \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"agentCount": 6}'
```
